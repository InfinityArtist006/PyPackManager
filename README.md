    🧱 Package Cards – Display each package as a clean, styled card

    📝 Detailed View – View detailed info like version history, links, and descriptions

    📂 Sidebar Navigation – Navigate with tabs like Home, My Packages, Categories, and About

    🧵 Threaded Search – Keeps the UI smooth during long operations

    📦 Offline Mock Data – Ready for real data integration in future releases

    ⚠️ This is a work in progress. Future updates will integrate real-time PyPI data and enhanced interactivity.
